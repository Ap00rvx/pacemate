    Background notification icon
    background_locator_2 will use @mipmap/ic_launcher by default if notificationIcon isn't set.
    We explicitly set notificationIcon: 'ic_launcher' in LocationCubit to avoid resource lookup issues.

    If you want a monochrome small icon to match status bar guidance, add it in res/drawable as ic_stat_name
    and set notificationIcon: 'ic_stat_name'.
